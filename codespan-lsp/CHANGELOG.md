## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.2] - 2020-10-XX

There is now a [code of conduct](https://github.com/brendanzab/codespan/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and a [contributing guide](https://github.com/brendanzab/codespan/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Changed

-   The error type in `codespan-lsp` is replaced with the error type in the `codespan-reporting` crate.
    The error type is now `codespan_reporting::file::Error`.
-   The `lsp-types` dependency was updated to use a version range: `>=0.70, <0.85`,
    which includes the latest updates in `0.84.0`.

## [0.10.1] - 2020-08-17

### Changed

-   The `lsp-types` dependency was updated to use a version range: `>=0.70, <0.80`,
    which includes the latest updates in `0.79.0`.

## [0.10.0] - 2020-07-20

### Changed

-   `codespan-lsp` only requires `codespan-reporting`, removing its `codespan` dependency.
-   The `lsp-types` dependency was updated to use a version range: `>=0.70,<0.78`,
    which includes the latest updates in `0.77.0`.

## [0.9.5] - 2020-06-24
## [0.9.4] - 2020-05-18

## [0.9.3] - 2020-04-29

### Changed

-   The `lsp-types` dependency was updated to use a version range: `>=0.70,<0.75`,
    which includes the latest updates in `0.74.0`.

## [0.9.2] - 2020-03-29
## [0.9.1] - 2020-03-23
## [0.9.0] - 2020-03-11

### Changed

-   The `lsp-types` dependency was updated to use a version range: `>=0.70,<0.74`,
    which includes the latest updates in `0.73.0`.

### Removed

-   `codespan_lsp` no longer depends on `codespan_reporting`.
-   `make_lsp_severity` and `make_lsp_diagnostic` were removed.
    It's pretty hard to map the diagnostic structure to LSP diagnostics - we
    recommend implementing this as an application-specific concern.
