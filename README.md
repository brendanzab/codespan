Utilities for dealing with source code locations.

## Supporting crates

Codespan also allows you to easily set up pretty diagnostic formatting for
command line interfaces via the [`codespan-reporting`][codespan-reporting]
crate. This will give you output that looks like the following:

[Rustdoc][codespan-reporting-docs]

In the future we would also like to make it easy for language developers to set
up language server protocols and interface with browser-embedded editors like
Ace or Monaco.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by rustc's error reporting infrastructure and the [codemap] crate. The
[language-reporting] fork also provided much needed inspiration towards
improving the API.
